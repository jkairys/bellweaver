# Bellweaver Documentation

**Last Updated:** December 1, 2025

## Project Overview

Bellweaver is a school calendar event aggregation and filtering tool that consolidates events from multiple sources and intelligently filters them based on relevance to specific children.

**Problem:** Parents receive overwhelming communication from multiple school sources (Compass, Class Dojo, HubHello, Xplore) with no unified view.

**Solution:** Single dashboard showing relevant calendar events for each child, powered by Claude API for intelligent filtering.

## Current Status

### What's Working ✅

1. **Compass HTTP Client** (`backend/bellweaver/adapters/compass.py`)
   - Direct HTTP authentication (no browser automation)
   - Calendar event fetching from Compass API
   - Session management with cookies
   - Fast performance (~1 second total)
   - Integration tests passing

2. **Mock Client** (`backend/bellweaver/adapters/compass_mock.py`)
   - Realistic synthetic test data
   - Same interface as real client
   - No credentials required

3. **LLM Filter** (`backend/bellweaver/filtering/llm_filter.py`)
   - Claude API integration implemented
   - Event filtering and summarization
   - Not yet integrated into pipeline

4. **Credential Manager** (`backend/bellweaver/db/credentials.py`)
   - Fernet encryption implemented
   - Not yet integrated with database

### What's Not Built ⏳

- Database layer (SQLAlchemy models, schema)
- Flask API routes
- Web UI

## Development Workflow

### Setup

```bash
cd backend
poetry install --with dev
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

### Testing

```bash
cd backend
poetry run pytest -v                                    # All tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_compass_client_real.py -v  # Integration tests
```

### Code Quality

```bash
cd backend
poetry run black src tests    # Format
poetry run flake8 src tests   # Lint
poetry run mypy src          # Type check
```

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables (in `backend/.env`):

```bash
# Compass credentials
COMPASS_USERNAME=your_compass_username
COMPASS_PASSWORD=your_compass_password
COMPASS_BASE_URL=https://your-school.compass.education

# Claude API (optional, for filtering features)
CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx

# Encryption key (auto-generated on first run)
BELLWEAVER_ENCRYPTION_KEY=
```

See `backend/.env.example` for full template.

## Development Roadmap

## Key Technical Decisions

### HTTP Client vs Browser Automation

**Decision:** Use HTTP client with direct requests

**Rationale:**

- Cloudflare blocks browser automation (even with stealth)
- HTTP client is faster (~1s vs ~10-15s)
- Simpler deployment (no browser dependencies)
- More reliable (fewer moving parts)
- Better Cloudflare bypass

### SQLite vs Cloud Database

**Decision:** Start with SQLite for MVP

**Rationale:**

- No server setup required
- Simple file-based storage
- Good enough for single-user local development
- Easy migration path to PostgreSQL/Cloud SQL later

### Fernet Encryption

**Decision:** Use symmetric encryption for credentials

**Rationale:**

- Simple and built-in to Python cryptography
- Suitable for local credential storage
- Key stored in environment (not in code)
- Good enough for single-user MVP

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Tests

- Real Compass authentication
- Calendar event fetching
- Various date ranges
- Error handling

### Unit Tests (Planned)

- Database operations
- Credential encryption/decryption
- LLM filtering logic
- API endpoints

### Test Data

- Mock client with realistic synthetic events
- Real Compass credentials for integration testing
- Synthetic user configs for filtering tests

## Troubleshooting

### Poetry Issues

```bash
cd backend
poetry lock --refresh
poetry install --with dev
poetry cache clear . --all
```

### Test Failures

```bash
# Verify .env has correct credentials
cat backend/.env

# Ensure you're in backend directory
cd backend
poetry run pytest -v
```

### Virtual Environment Issues

```bash
cd backend
poetry env remove python
poetry install --with dev
```

## Git Workflow

### Current Status

- **Branch:** main
- **Recent Work:** Compass client implementation and testing

### Never Commit

- `backend/.env` (contains credentials)
- `backend/.venv/` (virtual environment)
- `backend/data/` (user data and database)
- `__pycache__/` and `.pytest_cache/`

### Commit Style

- Clear, imperative tense
- Component prefix (e.g., "adapters:", "db:", "docs:")
- Example: "adapters: add HTTP-based Compass client"

## Common Tasks

### Adding Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
poetry add package-name                # Production
poetry add --group dev package-name    # Development
```

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
cd backend
poetry run pytest tests/test_compass_client_real.py::test_login -v
poetry run pytest tests/test_fixtures.py -v
```

### Updating Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
poetry update
```

## Performance Notes

### Compass Client

- Authentication: ~500ms
- Event fetch: ~500ms
- Total: ~1 second
- No browser overhead
- Session cookies reused within process

### Future Optimizations

- Database session cookie persistence (optional)
- Event caching to avoid repeated API calls
- Background sync jobs
- Rate limiting to avoid overwhelming Compass

## Security Considerations

### Credentials

- Stored encrypted using Fernet
- Encryption key in environment variable
- Never committed to git
- Database file gitignored

### API Keys

- Claude API key in environment
- Never hardcoded in source
- Rotation supported via environment update

### Session Management

- Cookies handled by requests.Session()
- Auto-cleanup on process exit
- Optional database persistence for cross-session reuse

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria

- User can authenticate with Compass
- User can fetch calendar events
- User can configure filtering rules
- User can view filtered events
- Events fetched and filtered within 5 seconds
- System works reliably with real data

### Future Success Criteria

- Support for 10+ concurrent users
- 99% uptime
- Automatic sync every 6 hours
- Support for multiple schools/sources
