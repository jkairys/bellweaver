# Tasks: Family Management System

**Feature**: 001-family-management
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-family-management/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Testing Strategy**:
- **Backend API**: Integration tests written test-first for all API endpoints (constitution principle II)
- **Frontend UI**: Manual testing initially (T092-T098), automated tests deferred to post-MVP
- **Test Location**: backend/tests/integration/test_family_api.py

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **Backend User Stories (Phases 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Phase 3): Can start immediately after Foundational
  - US2 (Phase 4): Extends US1, can run in parallel or immediately after US1
  - US3 (Phase 5): Independent, can run in parallel with US1/US2
  - US4 (Phase 6): Depends on US1 and US3 (needs children and organisations)
  - US5 (Phase 7): Depends on US3 (needs organisations)
  - US3 Extended (Phase 8): Depends on US3 and US4 (needs organisations and associations for delete constraint)
  - US6 (Phase 9): Depends on US5 (needs channels)
- **Frontend Phases (10-15)**: Depend on corresponding backend phases
  - Phase 10 (Child UI): Depends on Phase 4 (US1+US2 backend complete)
  - Phase 11 (Org UI): Depends on Phase 8 (US3 backend complete)
  - Phase 12 (Association UI): Depends on Phase 6 (US4 backend complete)
  - Phase 13 (Channel UI): Depends on Phases 7 & 9 (US5+US6 backend complete)
  - Phase 14 (State Management): Depends on Phases 10-13 (all components exist)
  - Phase 15 (Styling): Depends on Phase 14 (all components integrated)
- **Integration & Polish (Phases 16-17)**: Depend on all implementation phases

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Extends US1 - Adds edit/delete to child management
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Independent - Can run in parallel with US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Requires US1 (children) and US3 (organisations) exist
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Requires US3 (organisations) exist
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Requires US5 (channels) exist

### Parallel Opportunities

**Backend**:
- Phase 2: Tasks T004-T007 (ORM models) can run in parallel
- Phase 2: Tasks T011-T015 (Pydantic models, blueprint setup) can run in parallel
- Phase 3-5: US1, US2, US3 can run in parallel (different entities)
- Within each phase: [P] marked tasks can run in parallel

**Frontend**:
- Phase 10-13: Component development can run in parallel if backend is ready
- Within each phase: [P] marked tasks (API services, components) can run in parallel
- Phase 16: All manual testing tasks (T092-T098, T101-T102) can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch all ORM models together:
Task T004: "Add Child ORM model"
Task T005: "Add Organisation ORM model"
Task T006: "Add ChildOrganisation table"
Task T007: "Add CommunicationChannel ORM model"

# Then launch validation and setup together:
Task T011: "Create base Pydantic models"
Task T013: "Create family_bp blueprint"
Task T014: "Add error handlers"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only - Child Management)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Create first child)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Manage multiple children)
5. Complete Phase 10: Frontend for Child Management
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test child management end-to-end
7. Deploy/demo if ready - parents can now manage children!

### Incremental Delivery

1. **MVP**: Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2 + Child UI → Child management working
2. **Increment 2**: Add US3 + US3 Extended + Org UI → Organisation management working
3. **Increment 3**: Add US4 + Association UI → Link children to organisations
4. **Increment 4**: Add US5 + US6 + Channel UI → Compass integration working
5. **Polish**: State management, styling, testing, documentation

Each increment delivers testable value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (after Foundational phase complete):

- **Developer A**: Backend US1+US2 (Child management) → Frontend Child UI
- **Developer B**: Backend US3+US3Ext (Organisation management) → Frontend Org UI
- **Developer C**: Backend US5+US6 (Channels) → Frontend Channel UI
- **Developer D**: Backend US4 (Associations) → Frontend Association UI → State Management

Stories can complete independently and integrate at the end.

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 140+ (updated with API integration tests)
- Phase 1 (Setup): 3 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 12 tasks (BLOCKING)
- Phase 3 (US1): 6 tests + 5 implementation = 11 tasks
- Phase 4 (US2): 5 tests + 3 implementation = 8 tasks
- Phase 5 (US3): 5 tests + 5 implementation = 10 tasks
- Phase 6 (US4): 6 tests + 7 implementation = 13 tasks
- Phase 7 (US5): 5 tests + 9 implementation = 14 tasks
- Phase 8 (US3 Extended): 4 tests + 3 implementation = 7 tasks
- Phase 9 (US6): 3 tasks (view-only, minimal testing)
- Phase 10-17 (Frontend): ~70 tasks (manual testing only, per strategy)

**Test-First Compliance**: 31 API integration tests written before implementation (constitution principle II satisfied)

**Parallel Opportunities**: 50+ tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-4 = Child management (15 backend + 11 tests + 3 setup + 12 foundational = 41 tasks)

**Full Backend API**: Phases 1-9 = All API endpoints with comprehensive integration tests

**Full Feature**: All phases = Complete family management system with all 6 user stories

## Notes

- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- [P] = Parallelizable (different files, no dependencies within phase)
- [Story] label (US1-US6) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each phase builds on previous phases
- **Test-First Workflow**: API integration tests MUST be written before implementation (constitution principle II)
  - Tests verify API contracts, status codes, validation rules, edge cases, and success criteria
  - Implementation tasks reference which tests they must pass (e.g., "verify tests T016-T018 pass")
  - All tests in backend/tests/integration/test_family_api.py
- **Frontend Testing**: Manual testing via UI (T092-T098), automated frontend tests deferred to post-MVP
- Backend phases (3-9) should complete before corresponding frontend phases
- Foundational phase (Phase 2) must complete before ANY user story work
- Stop at any phase checkpoint to validate independently
- Each user story delivers independent value
