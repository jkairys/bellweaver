# Tasks: Compass API Decoupling and Mock Data Infrastructure

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-compass-api-decoupling/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1, 2, AND 3 should all work - mock data can be refreshed when API changes

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Selective CI Workflow Execution (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Optimize CI workflows to run Compass API library tests only when library code changes

**Independent Test**: Make changes to Bellweaver application code (not Compass library), trigger CI, verify Compass API library tests are skipped while Bellweaver tests run

- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (P2): Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) AND User Story 1 - Depends on US1 for mock mode
  - User Story 3 (P3): Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) AND User Story 1 - Depends on US1 for factory
  - User Story 4 (P4): Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent CI optimization
- **Testing (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
- **Documentation (Phase 8)**: Can proceed in parallel with Testing (Phase 7)
- **Docker (Phase 9)**: Depends on User Stories 1-3 being complete
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all previous phases being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Local Development**: FOUNDATIONAL - All other stories depend on this
  - Provides: create_client() factory, mock mode support, environment configuration
  - Blocks: US2 (needs mock mode), US3 (needs factory)
- **User Story 2 (P2) - CI/CD Pipeline**: Depends on US1 for mock mode functionality
  - Provides: Startup validation, CI configuration
  - Blocks: None (independent after US1)
- **User Story 3 (P3) - Mock Data Refresh**: Depends on US1 for factory and clients
  - Provides: CLI for updating mock data
  - Blocks: None (independent after US1)
- **User Story 4 (P4) - Selective CI**: Independent after Foundational phase
  - Provides: Path-based workflow filtering
  - Blocks: None (pure CI optimization)

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: Factory → Mock Client Updates → Bellweaver Integration → Remove Old Code
- **US2**: Mock Validation → Startup Checks → CI Configuration
- **US3**: CLI Creation → Data Sanitization → Schema Updates
- **US4**: Path Filters → Conditional Jobs → Status Check Configuration

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase (T002-T008)**: All package structure tasks can run in parallel
**Foundational Phase (T009-T013, T016-T018)**: All file moves and mock data can run in parallel
**User Story 1 (T023-T025)**: Mock client methods can be implemented in parallel
**User Story 2 (T037-T039, T040-T042)**: Validation and startup modules can be created in parallel
**User Story 3 (T052-T053)**: Sanitization functions can be implemented in parallel
**Testing Phase (T073-T079)**: All unit test files can be written in parallel
**Documentation Phase (T086-T091, T095-T096)**: All documentation updates can be written in parallel

Task: "Implement _load_mock_user() method in CompassMockClient"

# After methods complete, update consumers:
Task: "Update bellweaver CLI commands to use create_client()"
Task: "Update bellweaver API routes to use create_client()"
```

---

## Parallel Example: Testing Phase

```bash
# Launch all unit test files together:
Task: "Write unit tests for CompassClient in packages/compass-client/tests/unit/test_client.py"
Task: "Write unit tests for CompassMockClient in packages/compass-client/tests/unit/test_mock_client.py"
Task: "Write unit tests for CompassParser in packages/compass-client/tests/unit/test_parser.py"

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T008) - ~2 hours
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T009-T022) - ~4 hours
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T023-T036) - ~6 hours
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Can start app locally with COMPASS_MODE=mock
   - Mock data loads successfully
   - All API endpoints return data without credentials
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**Estimated MVP Time**: ~12 hours total

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2): Setup + Core package → Packages installable, tests pass
2. **MVP** (Phase 3): User Story 1 → Local development with mock data works ✅
3. **CI Support** (Phase 4): User Story 2 → CI pipelines work without geo-blocking ✅
4. **Mock Refresh** (Phase 5): User Story 3 → Developers can update mock data ✅
5. **CI Optimization** (Phase 6): User Story 4 → Selective test execution saves time ✅
6. **Quality** (Phases 7-8): Testing + Documentation → Production-ready
7. **Deployment** (Phases 9-10): Docker + Polish → Ready to ship

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Together**: Complete Setup + Foundational (Phases 1-2)
2. **Once Foundational is done**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Phase 3) - CRITICAL PATH
   - **Developer B**: User Story 4 (Phase 6) - Independent CI work
   - **Developer C**: Documentation setup (Phase 8) - Parallel docs
3. **After US1 complete**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 2 (Phase 4)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 3 (Phase 5)
   - **Developer C**: Testing (Phase 7)
4. **Final Push**: Docker (Phase 9) + Polish (Phase 10) together

---

## MVP Scope (Recommended First Delivery)

**Goal**: Get local development working with mock data

**Phases**: 1 (Setup), 2 (Foundational), 3 (User Story 1)

**Tasks**: T001-T036 (36 tasks)

**Estimated Time**: ~12-16 hours for single developer

**Deliverable**: Developers can run Bellweaver locally with mock Compass data without credentials

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story (US1, US2, US3, US4) for traceability
- **Each user story** should be independently completable and testable
- **Commit** after each task or logical group
- **Stop at any checkpoint** to validate story independently
- **MVP-first approach**: Focus on User Story 1 (P1) for fastest time-to-value
- **Avoid**: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
